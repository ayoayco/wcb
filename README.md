ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è zero-dependency, ü§è tiny JS base class for creating reactive [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) easily ‚ú®

![counter example code snippet](https://git.sr.ht/~ayoayco/wcb/blob/main/assets/IMG_0682.png)

When you extend the `WebComponent` class for your component, you only have to define the `template` and `properties`. Any change in any property value will automatically cause just the component UI to render.

The result is a reactive UI on property changes.

There's a trade off between productivity & lightweight-ness here, and it is somewhere between [Microsoft's FASTElement](https://github.com/microsoft/fast) & [Google's LitElement](https://github.com/lit/lit/).

## Inspirations and thanks

1. [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm) - I use it for the `html` function for tagged templates, and take a lot of inspiration in building the rendering implementation. It is highly likely that I will go for what Preact is doing... but we'll see.
1. [fast](https://github.com/microsoft/fast) - When I found that Microsoft has their own base class (super cool!) and I thought: okay, I don't feel bad about forgetting Lit exists now
1. [lit](https://github.com/lit/lit) - `lit-html` continues to amaze me and I worked to make `wcb` generic so I (and others) can continue to use it
