Often times, when simple websites need a quick custom element, the simplest way is to create one extending from `HTMLElement`. However, it can quickly reach a point where writing the code from scratch can seem confusing and hard to maintain especially when compared to other projects with more advanced setups.

Also, when coming from frameworks with an easy declarative coding experience (using templates), the default imperative way (e.g., creating instances of elements, manually attaching event handlers, and other DOM manipulations) is a frequent pain point we see.

By taking out bigger concerns that [a metaframework](https://github.com/ayoayco/mcfly) should handle, this project aims to focus on keeping the component-level matters simple and lightweight. This allows for addressing the said problems with virtually zero tooling required and thin abstractions from vanilla custom element APIs â€“ giving you only the bare minimum code to be productive.

It works on current-day browsers without needing compilers, transpilers, or polyfills.
