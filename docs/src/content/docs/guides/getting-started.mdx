**Web Component Base (WCB)** 
<Badge text="alpha" variant="danger" /> is a zero-dependency, tiny JS base class for creating reactive [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) easily.

When you extend the WebComponent class for your custom element, you only have to define the template and properties. Any change in any property value will automatically cause just the component UI to render.

The result is a reactive UI on property changes.

## Project Status

Treat it as a **stable alpha** product. Though the public APIs are stable, most examples are only useful for simple atomic use-cases due to remaining work needed on the internals.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
For building advanced interactions, there is an in-progress work on smart diffing to prevent component children being wiped on interaction.
</Aside>

In the mean time, if you have some complex needs, we recommend using the `WebComponent` base class with a more mature rendering approach like `lit-html`... and here's a demo for that: [View on CodePen â†—](https://codepen.io/ayoayco-the-styleful/pen/ZEwNJBR?editors=1010).

...or you can even [use just parts](#just-the-templating) of it for your own base class.

## Installation

The library is distributed as complete ECMAScript Modules (ESM) and published on [NPM](https://ayco.io/n/web-component-base). Please file an issue in our [issue tracker](https://ayco.io/gh/web-component-base/issues) for problems or requests regarding our distribution.

### Import via CDN

It is possible to import directly using a CDN like [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/web-component-base) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/web-component-base) in your vanilla JS component or HTML files. In all examples in this document, we use `unpkg` but you can find on CodePen examples that `esm.sh` also works well.

Additionally, we use `@latest` in the rest of our [usage examples](#usage) here for simplicity, but take note that this incurs additional resolution steps for CDNs to find the actual latest published version. You may replace the `@latest` in the URL with specific versions as shown in our CodePen examples, and this will typically be better for performance.

```js
import { WebComponent } from 'https://unpkg.com/web-component-base@latest/index.js'
```

### Installation via npm

Usable for projects with bundlers or using import maps pointing to the specific files downloaded in `node_modules/web-component-base`.

```bash
npm i web-component-base
```
